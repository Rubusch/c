## CONTENT

My collection of code snippets and demo programs in C.  

The code contained within this repository was compiled on a Linux PC
using Gnu’s gcc compiler. It should, however, build on just about any
platform that uses gcc. Naturally, this doesn’t apply if you’re
programming for Windows.  


## BUILD

The sources should build under Linux as follows:  

```bash
$ make
$ ./*.exe
```


## DISCLAIMER

No liability for the contents of this repository can be accepted. Use
the codes, concepts, examples and other content at your own
risk. There may be errors and inaccuracies, that may of course be
damaging to your system.  

Yes, ``.exe`` is a file extension common on Microsoft Windows.
Just recently in around 2004 I switched over to Linux, learning how
to build 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. So, here I choose ``*.exe`` for
simplicity for my of Makefiles, my quick&dirty CI scripts and the
test/verification scripts as a generalization for an excutable.
Please, feel free to rename everything to ``*.mickey-mouse`` and
call yourself "Linux Crack" if it makes you feel more convenient
