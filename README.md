## CONTENT

My collection of code snippets and demo programs in C.  

The code contained within this repository was compiled on a Linux PC
using Gnu’s gcc compiler. It should, however, build on just about any
platform that uses gcc. Naturally, this doesn’t apply if you’re
programming for Windows.  


## BUILD

The sources should build under Linux as follows:  

```bash
$ make
$ ./*.exe
```


## DISCLAIMER

No liability for the contents of this repository can be accepted. Use
the codes, concepts, examples and other content at your own
risk. There may be errors and inaccuracies, that may of course be
damaging to your system.
