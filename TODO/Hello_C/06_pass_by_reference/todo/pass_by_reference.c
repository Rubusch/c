/*
  Pass by reference means passing the variable directly and not
  just a copy of it's content.
  When we want to pass a variable by reference, we need to pass
  the address in memory (its reference) of the variable to the
  subfunction.
  Changes done by the subfunction will remain in the parent's
  value!

// TODO: change the code of pass_by_value.c that it will work by reference!
