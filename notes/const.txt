NB: when initializing an array by a "const int" size, in C99 this
becomes a VLA (variable lenght array), in C11 and if the compiler
defines the macro constant __STDC_NO_VLA__ to integer constant 1, then
VLA and VM types are not supported





EXAMPLE

What's the difference between the following three pointer declarations in C:

I)  void* const myPointer1;  // read: void* is const
II)  void const *myPointer2; // read: void is const
 or const void *myPointer3;  // same as 'void const *'

And which one is used to prevent:

	myPointer = somethingElse;

=> Read the rules from right to left:

    void * const myPointer1;
myPointer1 is a const pointer to void.

    void const *myPointer2;
myPointer2 is a pointer to a const void.

    const void *myPointer3;
myPointer3 is a pointer to a void const.

myPointer1 is a const pointer, so its value cannot be modified.
myPointer2 and myPointer3 are the same thing.





NOTE

- Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the
  data pointed to must not be declared const.

- Likewise, a function that calls a non-const function usually must
  not be const.

- It does not make sense for a const function to return void.

- const is pointless when the argument is passed by-value, since you
  will not be modifying the caller's object.
