inline

By declaring a function inline, you can direct GCC to make calls to
that function faster. One way GCC can achieve this is to integrate
that function’s code into the code for its callers. This makes
execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their
known values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not
all of the inline function’s code needs to be included. The effect on
code size is less predictable.

 - inline is used also to solve "external linkage" issues

 - If you are writing a header file to be included in ISO C90
   programs, write __inline__ instead of inline.

 - Alternatively declare: __attribute__((always_inline));
