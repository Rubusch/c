static means "belongs only to the specific compilation unit"

Static duration storage-class specifier with internal linkage at file
scope and no linkage at block scope.

Making a function static hides it from other translation units. In
consequence the function may appear as "unnused" warning

visibility


Storage class  | Lifetime           | Visibility
---------------+--------------------+--------------------------
extern         | program execution  | external (whole program)
static         | program execution  | internal (translation unit only)
auto, register | function execution | (none)
