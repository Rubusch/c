macro list

the examples shall demonstrate how to put an implementation of a simple data
structure into a preprocessor generator, to individually generate the
implementation of e.g. a linked list, prefix the functions and in case extend
by addional functions

alternatively write a list implementation in a library (where the macro approach
is not easily debuggable)

this macro approach is a powerful way of generating data structure code using
preprocessor concatenation, but use with care! the default should always be the
plain library implementation
